## The Arc Browser Approach (Alternative Style)

Arc/The Browser Company takes a unique "anti-corporate" approach:
- **Style:** Founder (Josh Miller) talks directly to webcam
- **Vibe:** Intentionally "amateurish" - looks like a vlog
- **Setting:** His actual bedroom with imperfect lighting
- **Why it works:** Creates authentic connection, stands out from polished ads
- **Frequency:** 3-4 videos/month

**Consideration for Oceara:** A founder-led "talking head" video could work well as a B-version alongside the polished AI-generated version.

---

## Key Statistics to Remember

- **66%** of video ads are under 30 seconds
- **73%** of consumers prefer short-form video for product discovery
- **93%** of B2B buyers say video builds brand trust
- **8 seconds** - average attention span to earn
- **70%+** completion rates possible with good short-form content

## Style Recommendations for Oceara

Based on this research, the Oceara video should combine:

1. **Water/Nature Footage** (like environmental campaigns)
2. **Data Visualization** (like PETAL/Loop Industries)
3. **UI Demo Moments** (like Zluri/Creattie)
4. **Clear Before/After** (like Slack's approach)
5. **Hopeful/Conservation Tone** (like Apple/Palau Pledge)

### Avoid:
- Over-complicated technical jargon
- Generic "corporate" feel
- Too many features (focus on ONE transformation)
- Forgetting the emotional hook

## AI Video Generator Notes

For Runway/Sora/Pika, based on what works in these references:

**Best AI-friendly scenes:**
- Water droplets/ripples (natural footage style)
- Abstract DNA visualization (artistic, less literal)
- Logo reveal animations (particle effects)
- Nature aerials (coastlines, lakes)

**Harder for AI:**
- Real UI mockups (may need compositing)
- Split-screen comparisons (better done in editing)
- Specific human expressions/emotions

**Recommendation:** Generate scenes 1, 2, and 5 with AI. Screen-record actual Oceara UI for scene 3. Use stock footage or AI for scene 4 contrast.

## Production Cost Benchmarks

| Quality Level | Cost Range | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| AI-Generated DIY | $0-500 | Runway/Sora + your time |
| Template-Based | $500-2,000 | Canva/After Effects templates |
| Quality 30-sec | $3,000-4,000 | Professional but focused |
| Premium Production | $10,000-50,000 | Agency-level |

**The Dropbox lesson:** Their $50K video drove $48M in revenue. Focus on message clarity over production value.
