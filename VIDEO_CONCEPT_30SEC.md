# Oceara 30-Second Video Concept
## For AI Video Generation (Runway, Sora, Pika, etc.)

---

## Video Title
**"From Water to Discovery — in Minutes"**

---

## Script (30 seconds)

### SCENE 1 (0:00–0:05)
**Visual:** Slow-motion water droplet falling into pristine blue water, ripples expanding outward. Aerial drone shot of a lake or coastline.

**Text Overlay:** "Every drop of water tells a story"

**Audio:** Soft ambient water sounds, gentle electronic music builds

---

### SCENE 2 (0:05–0:10)
**Visual:** Microscopic DNA helix visualization emerging from water particles. Glowing blue/teal strands floating upward.

**Text Overlay:** "Hidden DNA. Hundreds of species."

**Audio:** Music intensifies slightly

---

### SCENE 3 (0:10–0:18)
**Visual:** Clean UI mockup of Oceara dashboard appearing on screen. Data flowing in, species cards populating, a biodiversity map lighting up with detection points. Progress bar completing.

**Text Overlay:** "Upload. Analyze. Discover."

**Voiceover (optional):** "Oceara transforms environmental DNA into biodiversity insights—no coding required."

---

### SCENE 4 (0:18–0:25)
**Visual:** Split screen showing: (Left) Traditional scientist struggling with command line code, frustrated. (Right) Conservation team smiling, looking at beautiful Oceara report on laptop in the field.

**Text Overlay:** "Built for conservation teams"

---

### SCENE 5 (0:25–0:30)
**Visual:** Oceara logo forms from water/DNA particles. Gradient background (ocean blue → seafoam). Website URL appears.

**Text Overlay:**
- "Oceara"
- "The new era of eDNA"
- "oceara.io"

**Audio:** Music resolves, water droplet sound as logo appears

## AI Video Generator Prompts

### For Runway/Sora/Pika:

**Scene 1 Prompt:**
```
Cinematic slow-motion shot of a crystal clear water droplet falling into a pristine blue lake, creating perfect circular ripples. Aerial view transitions to show beautiful coastline. Golden hour lighting. 4K, photorealistic.
```

**Scene 2 Prompt:**
```
Abstract visualization of glowing DNA double helix strands emerging from water particles. Bioluminescent blue and teal colors. Particles floating upward like magic. Dark background with ethereal lighting. Scientific yet beautiful.
```

**Scene 3 Prompt:**
```
Modern SaaS dashboard UI appearing on screen with smooth animations. Data cards populating with species information. Interactive map with glowing location markers appearing. Clean, minimal design with blue and green accent colors. Tech product demo style.
```

**Scene 4 Prompt:**
```
Split screen comparison. Left side: frustrated scientist in dark office staring at complex code on old monitor, head in hands. Right side: happy diverse team of conservationists outdoors near a lake, looking at laptop showing colorful reports, pointing excitedly. Bright natural lighting on right, dim lighting on left.
```

**Scene 5 Prompt:**
```
Logo reveal animation. Water droplets and DNA strands swirl together and form into a modern tech logo. Background gradient from deep blue to teal/seafoam green. Particles settle. Clean, professional, hopeful feeling.
```

## Alternative 30-Second Concepts

### Concept B: "The Invisible Census"
Focus on the mystery of what lives in water — show empty-looking water, then reveal hundreds of species detected through eDNA. End with "See what's really there. Oceara."

### Concept C: "60 Seconds vs. 60 Days"
Show traditional biodiversity survey (boats, nets, taxonomists, weeks of work) compressed on left, vs. Oceara workflow (sample, upload, report) on right taking seconds. "What took months now takes minutes."

### Concept D: "Customer Testimonial Style"
Conservation scientist speaking to camera: "We used to spend weeks identifying species. Now we upload our samples to Oceara and have answers the same day. It changed everything for our marine protected area."
