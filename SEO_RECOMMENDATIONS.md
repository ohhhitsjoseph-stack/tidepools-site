**Why:** Added high-value keywords "no-code," "metabarcoding," and "software" for commercial intent.

### Meta Description
**Before:** Generic description without key benefits
**After:** Keyword-rich description mentioning species detection, biodiversity monitoring, invasive species, and the no-code differentiator.

### New Meta Tags Added
- `keywords` meta tag with 15+ target keywords
- `canonical` URL tag
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Twitter Card tags
- Schema.org SoftwareApplication structured data

---

## 2. Content Optimizations ✅

### Hero Section
- Added "metabarcoding" to kicker
- Included "species detection" and "biodiversity insights" in H1
- Expanded subtitle with technical terms (FASTQ, eDNA analysis pipeline)

### Feature Cards (Renamed & Optimized)
1. "Guided, no-code pipeline" → **"No-Code eDNA Analysis Pipeline"**
2. "Shiny visual dashboards" → **"Interactive Biodiversity Dashboards"**
3. "Confidence you can explain" → **"Explainable Species Identification"**

### Workflow Section
- H2 now includes "Automated eDNA Metabarcoding"
- Steps now include technical terms: "DNA Sequences," "Taxonomic Assignment," "Biodiversity Reporting"

### Comparison Section

- Adds "invasive species & conservation monitoring"

---

## 3. New Sections Added ✅

### Use Cases Section (NEW)
Four cards covering major eDNA applications:
1. **Invasive Species Detection** - Asian carp, zebra mussels keywords
2. **Endangered Species Monitoring** - Conservation compliance angle
3. **Water Quality Assessment** - Regulatory/public health angle
4. **Marine & Freshwater Biodiversity** - Comprehensive surveys

### FAQ Section (NEW)
Four FAQ items with Schema.org FAQPage markup for rich snippets:
1. What is eDNA metabarcoding?
2. Do I need coding experience?
3. What file formats are supported?
4. How accurate is eDNA detection?

---

## 4. Technical SEO Improvements ✅

### Accessibility & Semantic HTML
- Added `role` attributes to header, footer, nav
- Added `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby` to sections
- Added screen-reader-only class (`.sr-only`)

| Add case study pages with client results | High | Medium |
| Implement breadcrumbs | Medium | Low |
| Add sitemap.xml | Medium | Low |

### Content Strategy Recommendations

**Informational Content to Create:**
1. "What is eDNA Metabarcoding? A Complete Guide"
2. "eDNA vs Traditional Biodiversity Surveys"
3. "How to Collect Water Samples for eDNA Analysis"
4. "Understanding Taxonomic Assignment in eDNA Studies"
5. "Invasive Species Detection with eDNA: Best Practices"

**Commercial Landing Pages:**
1. /invasive-species-detection
2. /endangered-species-monitoring
3. /water-quality-assessment
4. /marine-biodiversity
5. /conservation-compliance

### Technical Improvements

1. **Add robots.txt** - Control crawler access
2. **Create sitemap.xml** - Help search engines index pages
3. **Implement hreflang** - If targeting international markets
4. **Add image optimization** - WebP format, lazy loading
5. **Implement Core Web Vitals monitoring** - Page speed matters

### Link Building Opportunities

Target these types of sites for backlinks:
- Conservation organization websites
- University ecology departments
- Government environmental agencies
- Scientific publications and journals
- Environmental monitoring industry publications

## 6. Keyword Tracking Checklist

Track rankings for these primary keywords:

### Tier 1 (Monitor Weekly)
- [ ] eDNA bioinformatics
- [ ] environmental DNA analysis software
- [ ] eDNA metabarcoding software
- [ ] no-code bioinformatics
- [ ] biodiversity monitoring tool

### Tier 2 (Monitor Monthly)
- [ ] eDNA species detection
- [ ] invasive species detection eDNA
- [ ] endangered species monitoring software
- [ ] water quality eDNA
- [ ] automated eDNA pipeline

### Tier 3 (Monitor Quarterly)

## 7. Competitive Positioning

Based on research, Tidepools should position as:

**Primary Position:** "The first no-code eDNA metabarcoding platform for non-technical conservation teams"

**Key Differentiators to Emphasize:**
1. No command-line required (vs OBITools, QIIME)
2. Stakeholder-ready reports (vs research-focused tools)
3. Built for conservation/ecology teams (vs general bioinformatics)
4. Integrated visualization (vs fragmented toolchains)
