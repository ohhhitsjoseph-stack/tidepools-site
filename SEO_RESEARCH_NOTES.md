## 4. Competitor Landscape & Positioning

### Major Players
1. **Illumina** - Hardware & platform leader
2. **Thermo Fisher Scientific** - Full solutions provider
3. **Qiagen** - Sample prep specialist
4. **Bio-Rad Laboratories** - PCR technology leader

### Software Competitors
- OBITools (open-source pipeline)
- QIIME 2 (established, but technical)
- Barque (fish-focused)
- eDNAFlow (automated but requires Nextflow/Singularity)
- Geneious (general bioinformatics, not eDNA-specific)
- ROSALIND (no-code but not eDNA-focused)

### Tidepools' Unique Position
**Gap in Market**: No dedicated no-code eDNA platform exists specifically for non-technical teams in conservation/ecology. Competitors either:
- Require command-line expertise
- Are not eDNA-specific
- Lack stakeholder-ready reporting

**Positioning Keywords to Own**:
- "eDNA bioinformatics for non-technical teams"
- "no-code eDNA analysis"
- "eDNA biodiversity reporting"
- "automated eDNA pipeline without coding"

## 5. Content Recommendations

### Missing Semantic Signals (Add to Page)
The current page is missing these important terms:
1. **"metabarcoding"** - Core methodology term
2. **"species detection"** - Primary use case
3. **"invasive species"** - Major application
4. **"endangered species"** - Conservation angle
5. **"water quality"** - Regulatory driver
6. **"conservation"** - Primary audience
7. **"ecosystem monitoring"** - Industry term
8. **"DNA sequencing"** - Foundational technology
9. **"FASTQ"** - Technical credibility (mentioned but could be expanded)
10. **"amplicon"** - Technical authority
11. **"COI" / "18S"** - Barcode markers
12. **"reference database"** - Technical process

### Recommended New Sections
1. **Use Cases Section** - invasive species, endangered species, water quality
2. **Technology Explainer** - brief metabarcoding explanation
3. **FAQ Section** - targets voice search & featured snippets
4. **Glossary** - captures informational queries

---

## 6. Technical SEO Issues to Fix

### Current Page Analysis

**Title Tag** (Current):
"Tidepools | eDNA Bioinformatics for Everyone"

**Recommended Improvement**:
"Tidepools | No-Code eDNA Metabarcoding & Biodiversity Analysis Software"
- Adds "no-code" (differentiator)
- Adds "metabarcoding" (core methodology)
- Adds "software" (commercial intent)

**Meta Description** (Current):
"Tidepools is the world's first eDNA bioinformatics tool for non-technical teams. Modern, sleek, and ocean-inspired."

**Recommended Improvement**:
"Tidepools is the world's first no-code eDNA metabarcoding platform. Detect species, monitor biodiversity, and generate stakeholder-ready reports—no bioinformatics expertise required."
- Adds "no-code" (key differentiator)
- Adds "metabarcoding" (methodology)
- Adds "detect species" (primary value)
- Adds "monitor biodiversity" (use case)
- Clearer value proposition

### Missing Technical Elements
1. **No structured data (Schema.org)** - Add SoftwareApplication schema
2. **No Open Graph tags** - Add for social sharing
3. **No canonical URL** - Add for SEO clarity
4. **No alt text for visual elements** - Accessibility + SEO
5. **No semantic HTML5 structure** - `<article>`, `<aside>` missing
6. **H1 is in hero, but no clear content hierarchy** - Improve heading structure

---

## 7. Heading Structure Recommendations

### Current Issues
- Only one H1 (good)
- H2s and H3s lack keyword optimization
- Missing H2 for major sections

### Recommended H2s (keyword-optimized)
- "eDNA Metabarcoding Made Simple"
- "Species Detection & Biodiversity Monitoring"
- "From Water Sample to Species Report"
- "Built for Conservation Teams"
- "Automated eDNA Analysis Pipeline"

---

## 8. Entity & Topical Authority Strategy

### 2026 SEO Trend Alignment
- **Entity-based optimization**: Search engines reward sites that comprehensively cover topics
- **Topical authority**: Own the "eDNA for non-technical teams" niche
- **E-E-A-T signals**: Add credibility markers (partnerships, scientific backing)

### Recommended Actions
1. Add client/partner logos with alt text containing keywords
2. Add scientific credibility section
3. Consider blog content targeting informational keywords
4. Add case studies with specific species/ecosystem mentions

---

## 9. Keyword Placement Priority

### Must-Include Terms (Add to Page)
1. eDNA metabarcoding
2. species detection
3. biodiversity monitoring
4. environmental DNA analysis
5. no-code bioinformatics
6. conservation
7. ecosystem monitoring
8. invasive species
9. water quality
10. DNA sequencing

### Natural Placement Opportunities
- Hero subtitle: Add "metabarcoding" and "species detection"
- Feature cards: Add "conservation" and "ecosystem monitoring"
- Workflow steps: Add "DNA sequencing" and "invasive species"
- Comparison section: Add "no-code" emphasis
